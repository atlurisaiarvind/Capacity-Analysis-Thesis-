# Full Capacity Analysis of Secunderabad Railway Station Systems and Enhanced Proposals to Improve the Station Functional Efficiency
*	Simplified methodologies to determine the optimal layout and geometry of the station.
*	Created a comprehensive framework for designing and managing timetable data for the station, enabling seamless 24-hour scheduling, and planning to maximize productivity and minimize downtime.
*	Identified critical functions represented by the Muller figure to design an efficient network representation for the station.
* Designed and implemented a powerful station capacity determining analysis with advanced transit-based metrics and time domain analysis to drive dramatic improvements in overall process efficiency and productivity.
